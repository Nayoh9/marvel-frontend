# HOW TO INSTALL NECESSARY SOFTWARES

To open and modify your project code, you will need to install: 

## VISUAL STUDIO CODE (VSC)

Can be downloaded from https://code.visualstudio.com/

## NODE

Can be downloaded from https://nodejs.org/en

# HOW TO CLONE THE REPOSITORY

- On GitHub.com, go to the main page of the repository > Above the list of files, click on "Code." > Copy the repository URL > Open your VSC terminal > 
Replace the current working directory with the location where you want to place the cloned repository > Type git clone, then paste the URL you copied earlier > 
Press Enter to create your local clone.

```
git clone ***https://***
```

This can also be done for the backend if you'd like to review it. However, it's not necessary to have the backend open on your computer since the server is hosted on Northflank.

# HOW TO INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES

Once opened in Visual Studio Code (VSC), you will need to install the 'dependencies.' This process is slightly different for the frontend and the backend. Below are the commands you will need to enter in your VSC terminal.

## frontend

```
yarn
```

## backend

```
npm install 
```

# HOW TO START THE PROJECT

To start the project in Visual Studio Code (VSC) after installing the dependencies, you will need to run the following command.

```
yarn dev
```

You will then see a localhost URL that you can open with your browser by clicking or copying and pasting.
